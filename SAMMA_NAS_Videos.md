## Playing Videos & Media on SAMBA NAS

You can mount _samba_ shares within _nautilus_ after installing these tools `sudo apt install smbclinet gvfs-backends cifs-utils` however you will not be able to strea media from _smplayer_ or _vlc_ because default `ffmpeg` is not compiled with _smb_ protocol support
