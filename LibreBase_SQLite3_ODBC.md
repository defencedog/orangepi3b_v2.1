# Connecting SQLite3 `.db` with LibreBase
It is assumed that you have full suite of Libreoffice installed

## Installing packages
```
sudo apt install sqlite3 libsqliteodbc unixodbc
```
GUI for customising settings `unixodbc-bin` is missing from repos [referenced here](https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/How_Tos/Using_SQLite_With_OpenOffice.org) we will thus use `nano`

## Driver settings
Driver file settings referring necessary libraries are mentioned below. You can see the contents of both files are autogenerated & are same
```
cat /etc/odbcinst.ini
cat /usr/share/sqliteodbc/unixodbc.ini
```
## Database settings
This file user needs to create & add information about `.db` location & type of driver to be used `nano /etc/odbc.ini`
```
